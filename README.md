# Commands

**Hardhat:**

-   `npx hardhat compile` to compile contracts and generate `abi` in `.json` of the folder `artifacts`

-   `npx hardhat node` to run the localhost and get test accounts

-   `npx hardhat test` to run test

    -   ensure that the `defaultNetwork` in `hardhat.config.js` is `hardhat` and put the private key of the test account in `.env` to charge the hardhat account for smart contract tests

-   `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost` (much faster) **or** `node scripts/deploy.js --network localshost` to deploy on the localhost

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat help
```
